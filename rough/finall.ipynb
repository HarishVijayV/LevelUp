      "3. **Network:** Tap into her personal network (family, friends, former teachers) and professional networks (LinkedIn). Inform them of her job search and desired roles. Networking often leads to unadvertised opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Tailor her resume and cover letter:**  Her resume should highlight her communication and problem-solving skills, even if gained through personal experiences or volunteer work. The cover letter should emphasize her enthusiasm and suitability for the specific company and role.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Practice interview skills:** Prepare for common interview questions related to customer service, teamwork, and problem-solving. Practice her responses and refine her communication style.\n",

      "**Concise Job Search Query Examples:**\n",

      "* **Option 1 (Broad):** \"Entry-level Customer Service Representative OR Admin Assistant remote OR [City/Region] work life balance\"\n",
      "* **Option 2 (More Specific):** \"Customer service representative entry level remote [Country/Region] Microsoft Office\"\n",
      "* **Option 3 (Company Specific):** \"[Company Name] Customer Service Representative entry-level\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Note:**  Replace bracketed information with her specific preferences.  She should experiment with different keyword combinations and filter options to optimize her search. Regularly updating her resume and LinkedIn profile with any new skills or experience will also improve her search results.\n",

however, Barcelona missed out on the league title to Real Madrid.[284] On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini\\'s record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona\\'s history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez\\'s 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\\nDespite Messi\\'s individual form, Barcelona\\'s four-year cycle of success under Guardiola – one of the greatest eras in the club\\'s history – drew to an end.[131] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara\\'s 369 goals to become Barcelona\\'s top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Clásico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[160][162] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[161][163] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy;

Messi’s play continued to rapidly improve over the years, and by 2008 he was one of the most dominant players in the world, finishing second to Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo in the voting for the 2008 Ballon d’Or. At the 2014 World Cup, Messi put on a dazzling display, scoring four goals and almost single-handedly propelling an offense-deficient Argentina team through the group stage and into the knockout rounds, where Argentina then advanced to the World Cup final for the first time in 24 years. After Argentina was defeated in the Copa final—the team’s third consecutive finals loss in a major tournament—Messi said that he was quitting the national team, but his short-lived “retirement” lasted less than two months before he announced his return to the Argentine team. Messi helped Barcelona capture another treble during the 2014–15 season, leading the team with 43 goals scored over the course of the campaign, which resulted in his fifth world player of the year honour.', 'score': 0.54971373, 'raw_content': None}], 'response_time': 1.76}\n"

however, Barcelona missed out on the league title to Real Madrid.[284] On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini\\'s record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona\\'s history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez\\'s 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\\nDespite Messi\\'s individual form, Barcelona\\'s four-year cycle of success under Guardiola – one of the greatest eras in the club\\'s history – drew to an end.[131] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara\\'s 369 goals to become Barcelona\\'s top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Clásico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[160][162] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[161][163] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy;

Messi’s play continued to rapidly improve over the years, and by 2008 he was one of the most dominant players in the world, finishing second to Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo in the voting for the 2008 Ballon d’Or. At the 2014 World Cup, Messi put on a dazzling display, scoring four goals and almost single-handedly propelling an offense-deficient Argentina team through the group stage and into the knockout rounds, where Argentina then advanced to the World Cup final for the first time in 24 years. After Argentina was defeated in the Copa final—the team’s third consecutive finals loss in a major tournament—Messi said that he was quitting the national team, but his short-lived “retirement” lasted less than two months before he announced his return to the Argentine team. Messi helped Barcelona capture another treble during the 2014–15 season, leading the team with 43 goals scored over the course of the campaign, which resulted in his fifth world player of the year honour.', 'score': 0.54971373, 'raw_content': None}], 'response_time': 1.79}\n",
